\section{Universities should provide official credits for MOOCs}
 
\subsection{Why credits?}

Currently, most universities do not provide official credits for MOOCs,
i.e. the student receives a certificate that cannot be counted as a
subset of an on-campus degree. We believe that credit should be offered
as soon as the two following conditions are met: (1) the identity of the
learner has been verified and (2) the test (\textbf{TBD} DO WE MEAN exam?) is a valid
measure of the target skills. Identity verification in an online context
is an intense field of development, where we will soon reach appropriate
solutions. The validity of the assessment is in the responsibility of
the teacher and belongs to the quality control that universities and
platforms are expected to operate anyhow.

Actually, offering credits has potentially deep consequences on the MOOC
ecosystem, namely on the high attrition rate of MOOCs. However, the
current drop-out rates are overestimated. Many registered students never
show up (sometimes up to 30\%). In addition, some participants only
register in order to be able to access the content provided by the MOOC
but without the intention to take the full course. Despite these two
elements, the rate of drop-outs remains high, which may interfere with a
credit system. In a nutshell, credits increase both the responsibilities
of learners and teachers. Students may feel more motivated to complete a
MOOC if the certificate is useful for the rest of their
studies. Universities may feel more concerned in bringing students to
achievement if the credits are necessary for a longer educational
process.  To reach a more reasonable completion rate, there are two
possibilities: (a) to carefully select the participants based on their
levels of pre-requisites and (b) to better support them during the MOOC,
especially those facing difficulties.


\subsection{MOOCs and Prerequisites}

One meaning of  
``open''  is that MOOCs are accessible to any
student independently of his background. This is a point of debate with
pros and cons. If those who do not have the prerequisites were filtered
out early on, the achievement rate would be higher but we would lose
this great openness and miss students with great potential. It occurs
that students without prerequisites nonetheless succeed, due to higher
engagement. In addition, since admission criteria may be somewhat
imprecise and based on limited information, it is appealing to allow
everyone the chance to try for success. We believe students should have
the right to take the risk of joining a MOOC despite missing
prerequisites. There is however an additional risk that students who
fail, and should have been excluded in the first place, develop a
negative feeling towards the institution, which is a concern for
universities that are substantially funded by their alumni 
\tbd{IS IT REALLY
A CONCERN? IF THE STUDENT FAILS, HE WILL NOT BECOME AN ALUMNI.} This is a
general concern in academia which runs on a combination of training and
selection.  We recommend to develop initiatives by which more students
could achieve a MOOC and obtain credits, while keeping the current
policy of universal access. These initiatives could explore richer
individual support, social dynamics (e.g. meet-up groups), analytics for
drop-out prediction, increase time flexibility, etc. In general, we
hypothesize that a strong investment in the quality of teaching will
contribute to lower attrition; we want students to feel that teachers
help them with hard process.

The rate of achievement is becoming an even more important concern with
credits because credits are usually aggregated in order to get degrees:
if 50\% of the students succeed the first MOOC, and among them 50\%
succeed the second MOOC, only 25\% of the original cohort are still on
the path towards a degree. Moreover, a degree usually covers
higher-order learning outcomes (creativity, sense of rigour, critical
analytic skills, skills of synthesis, reflection, ability to identify
problems, social skills, and so on) which are rarely addressed in MOOCs. We
recommend research on MOOC activities that support the development of
these high-level skills. Replacing exams by projects or even capstone
projects are examples of such activities.

\tbd{Jens: the story sounds like (1) on
one hand we do not want to exclude anyone, (2) on the other hand if
there are no prerequisites, teaching becomes quite challenging for the
instructors. Not sure every MOOC instructor is happy with option (2).

So we do not want to make a decision here whether to go for option (a)
or (b). It sounds like we somehow want to have both at the same
time. Maybe we should take a clear stand here. Maybe some experience
from The Open University could be mentioned here (no (a) here, everyone
may study, they have to invest in (b) though).

Maybe there are different types of MOOCs in this design space: some go
for (a) others for (b). We could write it like that here rather than
saying that all MOOCs do both.

\subsection{Universities' Role in the ECTS System}

\tbd{What is ECTS? spell out/define for international readers}

An interesting issue is to know if Universities will keep the monopoly
of issuing credits and certificates or if a broader variety of actors,
such as professional organisation or accreditation organisation, will
also decide to give credits.  If this ecosystem evolves in a natural
way, the value of given credits will depend upon the reputation of the
institution that delivers the credits. In Europe, there exist a system
for sharing credits, the ECTS system, that could regulate the
development of the campus+MOOC academic landscape.

\tbd{Following para is still rough and needs revision; also this section
  needs a conclusion}

We expect that universities may take an
incremental approach, initially offering
credit for separated versions of MOOC material that involve selective
big but not massive population. Students who sign up for ``verified''
enrollment, such as Coursera's Signature Track or edX Verified
Certificates, might be put
in separate discussion groups from the others.  
What obstacles, if any, currently exist to prevent such a scenario, and
should universities pursue such scenarios?
Reasons not to do so could include decreasing the educational value of
residential credit or interfering with the schools' business model.  For some
universities, we would like a follow-on activity on campus that would
weed out individuals who had cheated egregiously.  The follow-on
activity would also be a way to build affinity to MyU; this could be a
net win.
