@techreport{uk.gov.mooc-2013,
	Abstract = {This report on MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses), and Online
Distance Learning (ODL), considers the available literature, gives research
suggestions and recommendations, with the aim of giving an up to date
picture of the current state of knowledge and opinion about MOOCs and ODL,
how they are evolving, and to identify issues that are important. 

The report finds that there is no real consensus on MOOCs and gives equal
prominence to the enthusiasts and the critics. It makes the following key
points: conflicting perspectives on MOOCs divide education communities;
learning practitioners disagree about the value of MOOCs; formal
comprehensive analyses of MOOCs mostly concur that they are disruptive and
possibly threatening to current HE models; reporting of MOOC learner
experiences is positive; the MOOC is maturing -- and engaging with its
business and accreditation issues. 

The report was written by Stephen Haggard, with additional contributions
and expertise provided by researchers from the The Centre for Distance
Education (CDE) and The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education
(OBHE).
