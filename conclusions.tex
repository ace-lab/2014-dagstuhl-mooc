The invention of the printing press led to a
technical-intellectual ecosystem consisting of print shops, skilled
laborers, authors, editors, readers, publishers, and investors,
motivated by both profit and intellectual pride~\cite{febvre}.

The universities surrounded by such ecosystems---Frankfurt, Paris,
Strasbourg, Leiden, Venice---became the most influential of their
time, as the ideas and writings of their faculty gained wide visibility.

Like the printing press, 
MOOCs provide an opportunity not only to make a profit, but also
to spread ideas and gain reputation. They will therefore be an
essential vector of success and visibility in today's higher
education. They will help attract the best students and
faculty, provide them with modern learning environments, and in so doing,
contribute to the success of learners and institutions.
Universities wishing to retain their intellectual
prominence ignore this technology at their peril.
